# Car-Price-Estimation-Unleashing-the-Power-of-Linear-Regression
This project involved thorough data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and machine learning model development using a car dataset. After meticulous preprocessing and insightful analysis, a robust Linear Regression model was trained to predict car prices accurately. Model persistence was implemented for reusability.
